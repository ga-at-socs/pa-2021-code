Problem set: Unit 3, set 8.1

Problem statement: 

5. Consider the algorithm described by the following pseudo-code:
See problem 5 here https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=2721558&chapterid=81423

5g) Write python program that  im plements both recursive as well as the 
    iterative version of this algorithm. Test if with m = 3 and n = 4, and 
    check that the result matches your computed value in 5b.
